        <h1>Velarium — parallel execution fabric for your system.</h1>
        <p>Drop-in execution fabric that makes your system fast, scalable, and predictable—from public chains to air-gapped and highly regulated deployments.</p>
        <p>Velarium is an execution module you run inside your own stack. You keep your governance model and architecture; Velarium brings horizontal scale, JIT-optimized per-core performance, and policy-driven parallelism.</p>

              <h3> Your governance. Your sovereignty. Our execution engine.</h3>
              <p>
                Velarium is a horizontally scalable execution layer that runs inside your trust boundary—whether that’s a public chain, a private network, or a fully air-gapped deployment. It’s being built to keep your governance model and sovereignty intact: no asset migration, no hosted custody, no giving up control.

              <h3>Horizontal scale without monster boxes.</h3>
              <p>
                We’re designing Velarium as an HPC/HFT-inspired execution fabric for chains and coordination systems. The goal: scale out across commodity hardware, not up into overpriced monsters, and independently tune compute, memory, network, and storage to get predictable cost-per-transaction.

              <h3>Drop-in upgrade, no rewrite.</h3>
              <p>
                Velarium is meant to sit under your existing chain or coordination logic. Keep your contracts, tooling, and governance as-is, while upgrading the execution layer to a parallel, high-performance fabric.

              <h3>JIT contract recompilation for *your* case.</h3>
              <p>
                Velarium’s architecture strips away generic VM overhead. Contracts are specialized to your chain, workload, and configuration, compiled into sandboxed native code under a controlled runtime to maximize per-core performance.

              <h3>Built to degrade gracefully under adversarial load.</h3>
              <p>
                The execution model is explicitly designed to avoid global collapse under pathological or abusive workloads. Our aim is graceful degradation with preserved aggregate throughput and protection for well-behaved traffic.

              <h3>Parallelization policies & sequencer advisories.</h3>
              <p>
                Velarium helps your sequencer make smarter decisions. It can emit policy-based advisories to throttle or reshuffle flows within your governance rules, so pathological or abusive patterns don’t drag down everyone else—without breaking fairness.

        <h2>Where we are now</h2>
        <p>Velarium is in active R&D / PoC stage. We’re validating the architecture on [on what?]. If you run a chain, sequencer, or critical coordination system and want to experiment with next-gen execution, we’d love to talk.
        </p>
        <h2>We want to hear from you</h2>
        <p>We’re looking for a small number of design partners to shape Velarium’s roadmap and put the architecture through real tests.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>You run or are building a <strong>chain, rollup, or sequencer</strong> and are hitting parallelism / hardware cost ceilings.</li>
          <li>You operate a <strong>regulated or high-assurance system</strong> that needs on-prem or air-gapped execution but can’t accept “just put it in the cloud” answers.</li>
          <li>You’re exploring <strong>next-gen execution architectures</strong> and want to influence how parallelism, fairness, and governance interact.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If this sounds like you, let’s talk.</p>
